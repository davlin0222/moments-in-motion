-   Principles

    -   Repetition
    -   Alignment
    -   Proximity
-   1 - Text contrast techniques
    -   Font weight
    -   Font size
    -   Text color and opacity
-   HSL is superior to reason about colors
-   2 - Repetition techniques
    -   Find an interesting design element and find a way to reuse a part of it (for example, a line in a logo)
-   3 - Alignment is all about lines
    -   Only center short text, but it can work if it's nicely wrapped over multiple lines.
    -   Strong horizontal and verticle lines are important (makes the layout feel solid)
    -   Spacing is for achieving balance
-   Intentially breaking the design rules is what creates great design
-   4 - Proximity
    -   Use to create visual groupings
-   Typography
    -   Sans-serif font tips
        -   Inter
        -   Manrope
        -   Montserrat
        -   Poppins
    -   8 point grid
        -   One unit is 8x8px, create boxes with multiples of this.
        -   Use this for font size and spacing.
    -   Font-weight, only even hundreds (400 > 600 > 800)
-   Text contrast
    -   Avoid pure black and pure white
    -   Color, use 60%, 30%, 10% rule
-   Before coding
    -   Begin with basic wireframes (no details)

## [Design Better Than 99% of UI Designers](https://youtu.be/PGQnGEH7c-E?si=ewY93oCv7MFutQcT) (15 min)

-   1 - Typography. Stick to one font
    -   Otherwise find a website and take their font combination
-   2 - Spacing
    -   No golden rule
    -   One trick is spacing by relationship
        -   Use sizes multiple of 8px
        -   Create relationships by multiples of two of those spacings
    -   Keep spacing to images between 80 and 96 px
    -   Make colums of text no wider than 600px
    -   Larger the text size, larger the padding size
-   3 - Grids
    -   Place things into columns of two and three.
        -   The same column numbered rows line up.
-   4 - Break monotony
    -   Make some things break out of the grid.
-   5 - Colors
    -   Base color, background
    -   Primary color, call to actions and small details
    -   Neutral color, text
    -   Use both high and low opacities of these colors
-   6 - Visuals
    -   Videos and graphics
    -   Recommendations
        -   Pexels
        -   Spline community
        -   MidJourney
        -   Dall-E
    -   Promt tips, include: niche, style and colors
-   7 - Details
    -   There's a big risk of adding too much
    -   Keep it simple and minimal
    -   Examples
        -   Low opacity details behind images
        -   Gradients
        -   Subtle button highlights and shadows
