# Moments in Motion

This is a hobby project where I build a website for the fictional company Moments in Motion. They sell bracelets that embody the philosophy of cherishing meaningful experiences over material possessions. Each bracelet serves as a wearable reminder of special moments and cherished memories, allowing customers to carry their stories with them wherever they go. Through elegant design, thoughtful craftsmanship, and a commitment to mindfulness, Moments in Motion offers more than just accessories; they offer a connection to the moments that shape us and the connections that define us.

I also like thinking in terms of always making sure the project is "complete". Meaning, for every iteration, there will be something concrete to showcase.
